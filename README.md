# The More Creation Foundation

## About
The More Creation Foundation empowers people—especially from ethnic minorities and low socio-economic backgrounds—to build literacy and practise value creation. As we enter the AI age, our focus is helping individuals turn knowledge (from books and beyond) into projects that benefit others, building confidence, purpose and opportunity.
